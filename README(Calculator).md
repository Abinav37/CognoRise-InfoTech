# Simple Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator implemented in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations. The calculator allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), then displays the result.

## Features

- User Input: Prompt users to input two numbers and an operation choice.
- Perform Calculation: Perform the chosen arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Display Result: Display the result of the calculation.
- Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs and division by zero.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the script using the command:

    ```sh
    python calculator.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the calculator.

## Code Overview

- `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
- `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` and `b` or an error message if `b` is zero.
- `main()`: Main function that prompts user input, performs the chosen operation, and displays the result.

## Additional Features

- Improved error handling for invalid inputs.
- Loop for continuous use without restarting the program.
- Advanced operations like exponentiation, modulus, etc.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt (optional).
